    * Welcome to Terminal Eden's wildfire simulation.
	* Allow me to explain what you're looking at here.
    * This plane represents a terrain, and is comprised of small squares called "cells".

    * <i>Really</i> small squares.

    * There are just over 4 million cells in this simulation.

    * Each cell is a different color, representing its state.
    * And every state has a probability of turning into another state based on its surroundings.
    * The dark brown cells represent areas with no vegetation.
    * The light green cells represent areas with healthy vegetation.
    * The dark green cells represent areas with overgrown vegetation.
    * And when we start the simulation, you'll see fire represented as red cells.
    * These fires will start randomly when the simulation is running.
    * As you'll see, overgrown vegetation has a higher chance of catching fire than healthy vegetation.
    * And of course, cells with no vegetation will not burn.
    * This produces some interesting behaviors.
    * Let's start the simulation.

    * How about we get a closer look?

    * With a global wind variable set to East, you can see how this affects the fire propagation direction.
    * But what you might not notice is how it also affects the vegetation. Fire isn't the only thing that spreads.
    * Cells with healthy vegetation have a chance to spread to cells next to them without vegetation.
    * And cells with overgrown vegetation have a chance to spread to cells with healthy vegetation.
    * Additionally, grown and overgrown cells can spawn randomly, and then begin to spread.
    * Why don't you explore for yourself?
